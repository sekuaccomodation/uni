    <section id="allocation" class="tab-content">
      <h2>Hostel Allocation</h2>
      <p>
        Hostel allocation at Seku University is done by the school administration. The allocation process considers various factors such as student's year of study, availability of rooms, and any specific requirements mentioned during the application process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this approach is to ensure fair and efficient allocation of hostels to the students. The school administration strives to provide a conducive living environment for all the students, taking into account their preferences and needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that hostel allocation is not under the control of individual students. The school administration will communicate the allocated hostel to each student before the start of the academic year.
      </p>
